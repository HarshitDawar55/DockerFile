# Advantages of DockerFile!

- Docker File is the best way to create a Docker Image, it provides more customization than the <i>docker commit</i> command which is also used to create a docker Image.

- It is the advanced way to create a docker image as we can specify many advanced options in the docker file directly.

- It provides the capability to create a docker image for a particular use case. **For example, Just to host a webserver & soon as the webserver fails, the container fails and control is removed from the container and many more.** <i> I have uploaded the Docker File for the same. </i>
