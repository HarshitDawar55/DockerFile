# Apache Webserver with PHP!

:sparkles::fireworks::tada: Explanation of the Docker File present in this directory!!!!! :tada::fireworks::sparkles:

* This Docker File when executed, it will create a Docker Image which has Apache Webserver, php, php-fpm, ncurses, & net-tools installed in it.

* The Docker Image will be created on the top of Centos version 7.

* When a container is created using the docker image created after running this Dockerfile, that container will have Webserver running automatically on port 80.

  * When the Webserver is accessed, it will display a webpage which is displayed through a php file created by me!

  * Output of the Webpage will contain the IPAddress of the docker container & memory information of the system.

**Note: Instructions to run any of the docker file are mentioned in the main readme file for this repository! If you didn't read that file, then check out the file by clicking [here!](../README.md)**
